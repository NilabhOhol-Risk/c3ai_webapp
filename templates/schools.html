          Currently available non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 interventions are:
          <ol>
            <li> COVID-19 PCR Tests (Swab tests). </li>
            <li> Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at the protection level of <div class="popup"> N95respirator masks

                    <li>hand-washing for at least 20 seconds with a non-antibacterial soap, </li>

          U.S. public health decision-makers are relying on three types of policies
          to control the spread of the virus: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdowns">lockdown</a>
          , <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/contact-tracing.html">contact tracing and testing</a>,
          and total compliance by the U.S. public with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">recognized social precautions</a>.
        </p>
        <p> <b>Lockdown</b> can successfully minimize infections, which in turn,
          minimizes cases of severe illness, but does not make efficient use PPE,
          and does not enable in-person activities to resume.</p>
          <b>&#8594; Succeeds with <div class="popup"> objective 1

          <p> <b>Contact tracing and testing </b> is insufficient in the U.S. to control
            the spread of virus and does not make use of PPE, but under the paradigm of
            contact tracing, in-person activities have been permitted to resume.  </p>

              U.S., with many individuals questioning why they should comply.  Further, CDC
              guidance creates confusion by implying that social distancing is not needed when
              wearing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html">face coverings</a>, but distancing is still important, and precautions should
              be used together.  As a consequence, this policy has not controlled the spread of
              virus and does not make efficient use of PPE, but has partly permitted in-person
              activities to resume.</p>

              <br>
              <h4>Cleaning and Personal Hygiene</h4>
              <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
                <li>Ensure that building ventilations systems are working properly.</li>
                <li>Conduct cleanings per <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html">CDC guidelines</a>, particularly in areas
                  occupied by COVID-19 key contact individuals.</li>
                <li>Conduct frequent cleaning of bathroom stalls and sinks.</li>
                <li>Ensure sufficient supply of hand soap and paper towels for handwashing.</li>
                <li>Provide availability of hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>
                <li>Additional precautions can be considered, such as temperature checks and training students to cough/sneeze into their elbow. </li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Higher Protection for Teachers/Staff</h4>
              <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
                <li>Install Plexiglas barriers around the desks of COVID-19 key contact
                  individuals.  This will enable the teacher to speak without wearing a
                  mask, as long as they are behind the barrier.</li>
                <li>Provide a reusable face shield cap/visor to be worn <i>with</i> a
                  cloth mask by COVID-19 key contact individuals when closely interacting
                  with students and others.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, maintain social distancing of 6 feet around COVID-19 key contact individuals.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Higher Protection for Students in the Classroom</h4>
             
              It is anticipated that very few K-12 students will be identified as
                COVID-19 key contact individuals, but special planning should be accommodated for
                those that are.  Special planning is not necessary for students in the
                baseline low-risk group, but schools can choose to apply precautions more
                broadly.  The following are different options, for which
                only one need be implemented, but combinations could be considered.
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>Option 1:</u> Install Plexiglas barriers around student desks that will be occupied by COVID-19 key contact individuals.  A desk protected in this manner does not need require distancing of 6 feet from other desks.
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>Option 2:</u> Plan for COVID-19 key contact individuals to sit at desks along the side walls or back walls.  Separate each key contact individualâ€™s desk by a distance of 6 feet from all other desks, including desks occupied by other key contact individuals.
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>Option 3:</u> Designate entire classrooms to be occupied by students that are COVID-19 key contact individuals.  Separate each desk in designated classrooms by a distance of 6 feet from all other desks.  This option only makes sense if the school has many students that have been identified as COVID-19 key contact individuals.  COVID-19 key contact individuals should only have classes in these designated classrooms.
              <br>
              <br>
              

              <h4>Considerations During Transitions</h4>
              <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
                <li>i.	Individuals that pass in <div class="popup">transitional zones <span class="popuptext" style="font-size:13px">Hallways, stairwells, passageways</span>
                </div> are not considered a risk for transmission of the virus.  Plan classroom transitions to avoid prolonged periods of time with individuals occupying a transitional zone.</li>
                <li>Encourage use of hand sanitizer or handwashing during transitions.</li>
                <li>COVID-19 key contact individuals that must use an elevator should ride alone.</li>
                <li>Students that are COVID-19 key contact individuals should transition to their next classroom before other students, so that they are the first to enter an empty classroom with a clean desk.</li>
                <li>Provide a reusable face shield cap/visor to be worn <i>with</i> a cloth mask by COVID-19 key contact individuals during transitions.</li>
                <li>Otherwise, maintain social distancing of 6 feet around COVID-19 key contact individuals.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Activities Involving Physical Exertion</h4>
              <p>Physical exertion requires a higher rate of breathing, which increases the risk of viral transmission.  Example activities include athletics, dance, and taekwondo.</p>
              <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
                <li>It is not recommended that COVID-19 key contact individuals participate in physical activities that cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet, regardless of being indoors or outdoors.  </li>
                <li>If activities involve touching shared surfaces, such as sports balls, then all individuals should use hand sanitizer between touches, and touched items should be traded out or cleaned between rounds.  Alternately, individuals can wear athletic gloves.</li>
                <li>COVID-19 key contact individuals can cautiously participate in indoor physical activities that maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet.  Additional protection, such as wearing face shields, is still recommended.</li>
                <li>COVID-19 key contact individuals can participate in outdoor physical activities for which they can maintain social distancing of 6 feet.  As long as this distancing is maintained, the individual does not need to wear personal protection, such as a cloth mask.  Example activities include running, biking, swimming, tennis.</li>
                <li>Some outdoor physical activities may require occasional close contact.  If such contacts are short and do not involve a face-to-face interaction, then they are not a concern.  An example is a baseman tagging a runner out in baseball.</li>
                <li>If a COVID-19 key contact individual must conduct a prolonged interaction with others as part of outdoor physical activities, then the key contact individual should wear a face shield cap/visor for these interactions.  An example is a coach that is a key contact individual huddling with team members that are baseline low-risk individuals.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Indoor Activities Not Involving Physical Exertion</h4>
              <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
                  <li>Music: Instruments that are not blown, such as stringed instruments, are less risky.    It is recommended that COVID-19 key contact individuals be located at least 6 feet from other musicians and behind musicians playing blown instruments. The use of filters on blown instruments is also recommended.</li>
                  <li>Choir: Singing involves a higher rate of breathing and projection of oneâ€™s voice, which increases the risk of viral transmission.  It is recommended that COVID-19 key contact individuals be located at least 6 feet behind other singers.</li>
                  <li>Drama: Acting involves the projection of oneâ€™s voice, which increases the risk of viral transmission.  It is recommended that COVID-19 key contact individuals maintain social distancing of 6 feet with other actors and avoid roles in which other actors speak in their direction.</li>
                  <li>If activities involve touching shared surfaces, then all individuals should use hand sanitizer between touches, and touched items should be traded out or cleaned between rounds.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Visitors</h4>
              <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
                <li>Visitors that are COVID-19 key contact individuals should wear a face shield cap/visor with a cloth mask when inside school buildings.</li>
                <li>Whenever possible, visitors that are COVID-19 key contact individuals should maintain social distancing of 6 feet.</li>
                <li>If touching shared surfaces, then individuals should use hand sanitizer between touches.</li>
              </ol>
